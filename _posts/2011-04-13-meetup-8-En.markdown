Last `codefoodbar` at [Brooklyn Star](http://thebrooklynstar.com) Was put together in the span of three days without much planning but was great fun and delicious nonetheless. Do yourself a favor and get their cornbread or biscuts a go if you are ever in the neighborhood. 

EN Japanese Brasserie, is an old favorite of mine. Great Shochu and traditional japanese dishes with two great tasting menus and the best blue crab soup I've ever had. Lets dress to impress and have a great time at this one guys.
