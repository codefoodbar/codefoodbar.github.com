Last `codefoodbar` at [Cafe Steinhof](http://www.cafesteinhof.com/) was a great success. There was much talk of float integer conversion in php and other highfalutin code talk. Oh wait... fuck that --two pounds of wiener schnitzel and veal broutwurtch-- that's what was awesome. On a side note: I'm told there were a few vegetarians who missed out for fear that there'd being nothing for them to eat, but Steinhof has fabulous vegetarian breaded dumplings (as I mentioned in the previous post). Whenever we plan on a place with no vegetarian options, that will be explicitly stated in the post. 

Speaking explicitly: Vegetarian options at the place our next meetup Traif where even the donuts are covered in bacon. 

Traif is a tapas place that specializes in pork. Wonderful delicious pork done in a multitude of styles. You can tell all of this from their sign

Their menu changes weekly but there are a few options that are usually on it. One being their bacon wrapped dates which might be the closet thing to heaven a non kosher Jew can get close to.
