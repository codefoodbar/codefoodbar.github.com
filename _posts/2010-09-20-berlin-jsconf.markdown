When I announced the first Code(Food,Bar) at the beginning of the year a number of people from outside of NY, and more notably outside the US wanted to get involved. I've been privileged this year to have work take me around the world and so this week as a prelude to the EPIC-ness of [JSConf.eu](http://jsconf.eu), Berlin will host its first event ["Eat, Drink Be Nerdy"](http://eat.precis-project.com/).

Thanks to the hard work of [Tiffany (@theophani)](http://twitter.com/theophani) and some help from [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/) all the foodie nerds decending and living in Berlin will be able to enjoy a three course (+ wine!!) Southern German dinner.

[Check out the full menu and details here.](http://eat.precis-project.com/)

I'm going sort of pavlov for the beef cheeks.

Space is limited and RSVP's are required. Please email <a href="&#109;a&#105;l&#116;&#111;:&#116;&#105;&#102;&#102;&#97;&#110;&#121;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#101;&#99;&#105;&#115;&#45;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#106;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">Tiffany</a> to get on the list.
