Last `codefoodbar` at [Traif](http://www.traifny.com//) Will probably never be topped. But that isn't surprising since it's the best restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of dining at. But will are going to try. I know codefoodbar has been on a bit of hiatus and it's hard to get back into the swing of things but I think we have a good lineup for the next few months

Sweetwater Tavern is a cosy cafe recommended by a good friend. Sparse but tasty menu with excellent specials. I'm expecting a small turnout since it's been a while but expect good food and drinks and great conversation.
