Another spring, another JSConf. Are you prepared for a couple non-stop days of epic mind bending JavaScript. I can't handle something like that on an empty stomach. Sure theres going to be tons of delicious beer and food (how is anything else possible in a city like Portland?), but there are some of us who want to go a little beyond. CodeFoodBar to the rescue. 

As always finding a venue was a bit of a challenge. Not that theres any shortage of great eats in PDX, quite the opposite. The challenge is finding some place that can acommodate a fair number of hungry nerds feed them and do it with class. We think we've found the place.

[Grüner](http://www.grunerpdx.com/about.htm) is a cozy restaurant serving "alpine" cusine in downtown Portland. Their chef [is up for a James Beard award](http://www.portlandfoodanddrink.com/2011/03/james-beard-foundation-awards-nominees-announced/) and if you saw the menu, you'd probably drool all over your macbook. I'm going to keep it a secret (because its fun) but lets just say it involves the words _"Charcute Garnie"_. 

Thanks to the generous support of [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com), not only will we be having a full 3 course dinner with hors d'oeuvers but there will also be generous amounts of beer, wine and cocktails. The restaurant is usually closed Sunday nights as well so we'll have the place to ourselves and really be able to celebrate before heading over to the opening JSConf party.

The restaurant is not big though, so we have a very hard cap and can't fit anymore then that. If you miss out buying a ticket, make sure you follow [@codefoodbar](http://twitter.com/codefoodbar) as I'll be announcing if there are any dropouts. *You must have a ticket in order to attend.*

So get ready for a very full night of delicious food and drink. What better way to kickoff the most epic conference of all time?
