It's been more than a little while. Between [an amazing conference](http://funconf.com/), moving, and insane two weeks in europe I have been lax in getting code food bar back up and running. No longer. 

I love simple feeling meals. Exotic courses and tasting menus are great but some times I just want a plate of simple well cooked meat. And Cafe Steinhof delivers. Good beer selection, very authentic Bavarian cuisine and amazing bread dumplings if you are a vegetarian. I think an awesome place to bring `CodeFoodBar` back to life. 

I'm still getting a feel for everyone's schedule for the coming month. Mondays do not work for this place. Right Now I'm thinking Thursday the 5th at around 7 but leave  a comment if you want to go and if needed days that work better for your schedule.
