Let's just say I'm really excited about this group and the potential
to hang out, eat good food, and hack with some brilliant gourmands.

I have some cool ideas for the near and distant future, but I'd love
to hear your thoughts and ideas, too.

Heres the general gist of what I'd like to see us _achieve_:

* Regular/Monthly outings to restaurants where we can talk shop, then
maybe proceed after to a bar.
* Regular hack/cook fests at peoples houses.
* Excursions - I already do this with some friends, but its really fun
* trips out to the _outer_ outer-buroughs and beyond in the name of
food.

Some things to consider:

#### For restaurants:

* the regular get-togethers should accommodate a decent amount of
people. As much as I love the tiny holes-in-the-walls, we probably
can't cram a bunch of people in them at once.
* They probably have to be reasonably priced. I'd say once in a
while I'd love to go to a place with you folks and ball out on a
tasting menu, but that probably cant be a regular thing.
* They have to accommodate vegetarians. The place doesn't have to be
vegan, but it should have some veggie options (looking out for my man,
@atduskgreg)
* Also, we probably have to put into place some sort of simple RSVP
system since we'll need to call places in advance if its going to be >
6 people.

#### For cook/hack fests:

* I would love for people to volunteer for opening up your apt. You
can say how many people you want and we can limit it to that. Also you
can charge at the door or request ingredients if you're
cooking/supplying food stuffs.
* I think I'll open up my doors for the first one and see how it goes.

#### In terms of tech:

* I don't think you should have to be a programmer to come to an
event. Spouses/Partners/Friends should be welcome as long as they don't
roll their eyes when we start diving into arguments about unit testing
frameworks. Language preference/experience in cooking or coding should
not stop anyone from attending.

The general idea is: lets have a good time, blow off some steam, hack
on some cool projects, and most importantly - _eat!_
