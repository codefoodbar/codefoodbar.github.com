I've been trying to figure out how to get everyone to my 'hood in Brooklyn for a while. What better way then unbelievable good italian food in a warm but hip atmosphere! Its snowing as I write this, and the thought of Frankies 457's world famous (or at least Brooklyn Famous) meatballs is making me drool all over my keyboard. Frankies has been a neighborhood staple for quite some time. [Heres a rave review from the Times from 2004.](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/24/dining/24UNDE.html)

Its also famously small, and famously hard to get a table as they don't take reservations . . . except for groups. So seeing as we're a group, heres the deal: They'll be serving a [fixed 3 course or 4 course menu, 35$ or 45$ respectively.](http://www.frankiesspuntino.com/457/menus-groupdining457.php) It's all family style, meaning large portions shared between the table. Unfortunately, this round is not veggie friendly. The cost doesn't include tip or drinks. I'll also mention that I'm planning to make continue the party after dinner, as there are a number of really great bars within walking distance of the restaurant.

[As I mentioned in the previous post](http://codefoodbar.org/2010/02/25/format-changes-or-why-nyc-is-the-best-and-worst-city-for-this-group.html) I'm going to ask for a sort of down payment on the meal to ensure your spot. Theres only room for 10 total this time, but if you cant make it or dont signup in time, dont fret - I'm going to try to do this way more often. 

Heres how its going to work. If you want to come, comment on this post, and I'll send you a link to pay me 10$ through venmo. Once you've paid, mark your calendar and I'll see you on the 8th. The 10$ will go towards you're meal.
