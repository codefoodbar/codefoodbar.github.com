title: First Meetup - Tues, Jan 19th @ Congee Village

I'm pleased to announce the first meetup of code(food,bar) at the excellent and endlessy fun Cantonese establishment [Congee Village](http://www.congeevillagerestaurants.com/). I think its an ideal first location because of its size, its huge menu, and its relatively easy to access location. There are actually two Congee Villages within walking distance to each other, but I'm referring to the grander and newer Congee Village on the Bowery.

I love this place dearly. Not only can you get some of the most delicious mouth watering cantonese style chicken, but you can also sip on lychee martini's or what they call 'liquid cocaine' (no joke). 

Highlights from the menu include: 

* crispy deep fried pork chops 'peking style'
* snow pea leafs in garlic broth
* home style tofu casseroles
* and of course CONGEE!

Heres the info:
