title: "Meetup #3, Mon, April 26 @ HanGawi"

It's been a little while. Between conferences and [foreign endeavors](http://codefoodbar.org/2010/03/10/special-meetup-in-edinburgh.html) our little group has been neglected. No longer. 

If I mention vegiterian food, as a omnivore, your first thought is probably of a booring salad or a mess of seitan and meat substitues in sauces that mask the faux taste. I love meat more than anyone, but I also love interesting food no matter what the ingredients. Enter [HanGawi](http://www.hangawirestaurant.com/). Korean food is noted for its bombastic flavors and often associated with a sort of outright just meat menu (Bulgogi, etc.). HanGawi offers a unique respite from the why-do-my-clothes-smell-like-grease world of 32nd St. and K-Town. You'll be greated with delicous tea, comfortable cushions, and some of the best KimChee in town.

We're not required to, but a good suggestion (and deal) is the Emperor's Tasting Menu which is a full four-course meal. The attire is casual, but note that you'll have to take your shoes off, so consider washing your socks. The cost is a bit higher then the average K-Town dinner - probably about ~$50-$60 depending on what you get - but I haven't been let down in the past.

**To reserve a spot:** I need $15 to reserve your spot (thats actually the amount required by the restaurant). There are 9 spots available. [Please pay via venmo](https://venmo.com/quirkey?txn=pay&amount=15&note=for+code+food+bar+at+hangawi) and I'll let you know you're added to the list.
